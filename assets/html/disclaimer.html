	<p>This app allows you to generate random passwords. The
	randomness comes from atmospheric noise, which for many purposes is
	better than the pseudo-random number algorithms typically used in
	computer programs.
	<p>
	
	<p>The passwords generated are not logged or stored
	anywhere.</p>
	
	<p>However, the best data security practice is not to let
	anyone but yourself generate your most important passwords. </p>
	
	<p>So, feel free to use these passwords for your wi-fi encryption or for that extra
	Gmail account, but you shouldn't use any online service to generate
	passwords for highly sensitive things, such as your online bank
	account.</p>
